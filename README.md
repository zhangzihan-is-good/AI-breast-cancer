## Dataset
This study utilized the following two datasets:

- **The Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD):**  
  This database was conducted on 1,775 patients from China with benign or malignant breast disease who underwent mammography examination between July 2012 and January 2016. The database consists of 3,728 mammographies from these 1,775 patients, with biopsy-confirmed types of benign or malignant tumors. For 749 of these patients (1,498 mammographies), the database also includes patients' molecular subtypes. Image data were acquired on a GE Senographe DS mammography system. The data can be obtained from this [link](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70230508).
